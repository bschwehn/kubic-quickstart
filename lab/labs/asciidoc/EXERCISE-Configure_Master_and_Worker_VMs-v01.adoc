[[task-1-configure-the-kubic-master-vm]]
Task 1: Configure the Kubic-Master VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  From the main Virtualbox screen, choose the *Kubic-Master* VM and
click on the down arrow next to the start icon. Click on Detachable
Start
2.  Log into the command line:
+
Userid: *root*
+
Password: *[your root password]*
3.  Start the curses version of yast to configure networking
+
yast2 lan
4.  Use the *F4* key on your keyboard to edit
5.  Use the *tab* key to navigate around the screen
6.  Change the IP address to *10.0.2.11*
7.  Change the Hostname to *kubic-master*
8.  Use the *F10* key to go the next screen
9.  User the **alt s **keys to go to the Hostname/DNS screen
10. Change the Hostname to *kubic-master*
11. Use the *F10* key to finish:

[[task-2-configure-the-kubic-worker1-vm]]
Task 2: Configure the Kubic-Worker1 VM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  From the main Virtualbox screen, choose the *Kubic-Worker1* VM and
click on the down arrow next to the start icon. Click on Detachable
Start
2.  Log into the command line:

Repeat Task 2 for each worker node. Add 1 to the IP address and hostname
for each node that you configure using the pattern in this section.
+
 +
All nodes should be able to ping 10.0.2.2, each other, and an internet
website.
