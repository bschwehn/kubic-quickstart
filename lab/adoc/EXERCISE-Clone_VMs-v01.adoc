==== Task 1: Create the Kubic Master Node

. Right-click on the [gray]*Kubic-CloneMaster* VM and choose *Clone*
. In the [gray]*Name* field, enter:
{nbsp} +
*Kubic-Master*
. In the [gray]*Mac Address Policy* field, choose:
{nbsp} +
*Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters*
. On the [gray]*Clone type* screen, choose *Linked Clone*
{nbsp} +
Click *Clone*

==== Task 2: Create a Kubic Worker Node

. Right-click on the [gray]*Kubic-CloneMaster* VM and choose *Clone*
. In the [gray]*Name* field, enter:
{nbsp} +
*Kubic-Worker1*
. In the [gray]*Mac Address Policy* field, choose:
{nbsp} +
*Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters*

Click *Clone*
. Repeat this task once more and create *Kubic_Worker2*. You may
repeat as many times as you like as long as you have memory and disk
space for each node.

[NOTE]
The *Kubic-CloneMaster* VM can be deleted at this point if you donâ€™t think
you will need more nodes or it can be left as a template. If it is
deleted, it can always be recreated using the steps in the previous
section.
